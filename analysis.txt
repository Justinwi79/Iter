    "remove_if" is a predicate function called to iterate through
 a list and remove elements that are true to a predefined function it 
 is called by. Each given element is tested by the function until 
 the iterator reaches the tail. The time complexity is O(n) and the range 
 is determined by the number of elements passed in. 



template <typename T> 
template <typename PREDICATE> 
void cop4530::List<T>::remove_if(PREDICATE pred)
{
   iterator itr = begin();
   while(itr != tail) 
   {                       
      if(pred(*itr))
         {
            erase(itr); 
         }
         itr++;      
   }
}
